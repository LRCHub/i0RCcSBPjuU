Full of the thirst of the ugly energy of cowardice hopeful and the hopeless hope down in the laughing stock
The hunger of loneliness has fed better men than me
We're going to make a difference to everything that moves has gone all wrong lately

I am thirsty European
I sit at bay in silence
Gathering their gathering down in the laughing stock
This could be the wandering to stop the wandering we're going to make a difference to everything that moves has gone all wrong

Degenerate monsters were always going to thrash the slander bang the stones in praise of the popular schools
Who can't remember their names they got lost in the lies

They won't just die for anyone forever
Couldn't it be right to always be right
Here and by besides

Thirsty European

Pass it round
Throw up your money
For the angel clipper with the brainwash cheeks
That lost their rosy
These past weeks
Living through hell living through hell
Carry me to Christmas with bells on my toes
Through Dublin streets on my musical feet
Got no regrets no thanks to give
But mother I've been living through hell again
