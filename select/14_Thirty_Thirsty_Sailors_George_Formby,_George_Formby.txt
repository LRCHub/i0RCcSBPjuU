Now there s a ship that's homeward bound and it's been to Timbuctoo
And on that ship that's homeward bound there's a very thirsty crew
They've been on the wagon sixty days or more
And every night on the lower deck you'll hear the sailors roar

Thirty thirsty sailors sailing on the sea
Thirty thirsty sailors they're as thirsty as can be
Thirty thirsty sailors, they don't pine for love
Thirty pints of foaming glory, all they're thinking of

Yo ho ho and bottle of rum puts hair upon your chest
You'll hear thirty thirsty sailors holler beer is best in barrells
Soon they'll be in Pompey, spending ten bob notes
Pouring pints of wallop down their thirty thirsty throats

Thirty thirsty sailors, sailing on the sea
Thirty thirsty sailors they're as thirsty as can be
Soon you'll hear loud speakers, shout with all their might
"Mothers, keep your girls at home, the fleet's lit up tonight"

Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum puts hair upon your chest
You'll hear thirty thirsty sailors holler beer is best in barrels

If they throw a party, you'll hear bits of fluff
Shouting, "Where's my hat and things, the party's getting rough"
Thirty thirsty sailors sailing on the sea
Thirty thirsty sailors they're as thirsty as can be

When the battle's over, all the married men
Will go home and stoke the fire, then off to sea again

Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum puts hair upon your chest
You'll hear thirty thirsty sailors holler beer is best in barrels

Girls will tell each other when the night is through
Never was so much done for so many by so few

Pouring pints of wallop down their thirty thirsty throats
